# 3D_CubeProduct 
Overview

A LED cube is like a LED screen, but it is special in the case that it gives output in a 3D space, making it more realistic. 3D LED Cube is a really cool device that enables you to see in three dimensions and get a depth perception. It has 512 LED’s and is based on a microcontroller with some standard interfacing pinouts that allow you to quickly assemble prototypes.


Specifications:
➔ This LED cube has 512 LEDs.
➔ Instead, our LED cube rely on an optical phenomenon called P ersistence of
Vision( POV).
➔ If you flash a LED really fast, the image will stay on your retina for a little while after the
led turns off.
➔ With this setup, we only need 64 (for the anodes) + 8 (for each layer) IO ports to
control the LED cube.
➔ Output of the transistor is given to the LED’s. Which controls the shifting of LED layer.
