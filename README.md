# 3D_CubeProduct 

## Overview

A LED cube is like a LED screen, but it is special in the case that it gives output in a 3D space, making it more realistic. 3D LED Cube is a really cool device that enables you to see in three dimensions and get a depth perception. It has 512 LED’s and is based on a microcontroller with some standard interfacing pinouts that allow you to quickly assemble prototypes.

## Specifications:
+ This LED cube has 512 LEDs.
+ Instead, our LED cube rely on an optical phenomenon called P ersistence of Vision( POV).
+ If you flash a LED really fast, the image will stay on your retina for a little while after the led turns off.
+ With this setup, we only need 64 (for the anodes) + 8 (for each layer) IO ports tocontrol the LED cube.
+ Output of the transistor is given to the LED’s. Which controls the shifting of LED layer.

## Key Components: 
+ 512 Blue LED’s
+ Resistors(10K) 
+ Soldering Kit 
+ Jumper Wires
+ Microcontroller board (Arduino UNO R3)
+ 74HC595 IC
+ Transistor
